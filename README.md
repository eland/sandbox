<h2>100mins</h2>

<p>This file contains various snippets of code I typed to get more of a handle on the <a href='http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html'>Ruby in 100 Minutes</a> introduction.</p>

<h2>intro-to-rails</h2>
<p>This is the app (in the tasks subfolder) that one builds while following along with <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/the-intro-to-rails-screencast-i-wish-i-had/">The Intro to Rails Screencast I Wish I Had</a>. It's a great introduction to test-driven development with RSpec for someone at least glancingly familiar with how Rails works.</p>

<h2>roman_numerals.rb</h2>
<p>This contains a method that parses roman numerals, partly written at a ruby beginners meetup, then finished by myself.</p>

<h2>blog</h2>
<p>Created while following the getting started guide at <a href='http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org'>RailsGuides</a></p>

<h2>dreamCal-alpha</h2>
<p>My first (in-progress) attempt at creating a Rails app from scratch. I expect to redo everything at least once later on</p>
